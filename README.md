## Overview
MunchBox is a social media recipe app designed for food lovers who enjoy discovering and sharing new recipes with others. This app allows users to search for and upload recipes, upvote and downvote recipes based on their popularity, and take pictures of their dishes to share with the community.

### Description
MunchBox is designed with a user-friendly interface to allow users to easily browse through many recipes. One of the unique features of this app is its integration with social media functionalities, such as an upvote and downvote system, as well as a commenting system. The upvote/downvote system helps to showcase popular and highly-rated recipes, while the commenting system allows users to interact with each other by sharing tips and experiences. Additionally, the app allows users to take pictures of their dishes and share them with the community. This feature is a great way to showcase one's culinary skills and inspire others to try new recipes.


### App Evaluation

- **Category:**
    - This app falls under the food and drink category because its primary purpose is to provide users with access to a wide range of recipes and cooking-related content. At the same time, it also falls under the social networking category since it allows users to interact with each other by sharing, commenting on, and upvoting/downvoting recipes.
- **Mobile:**
    - Munchbox aims to provide real-time information about trending recipes as users continue to interact with the app. Other real-time data include comments, upvotes/downvotes, and newly shared recipes. The app also utilizes the built-in camera to share images of one's dishes on the platform. This can help increase user engagement and make the app more unique.
- **Story:**
    - As college students who are often busy with classes, studying, and extracurricular activities, sometimes we leave little time to plan and prepare meals. We want to provide others with a time-saving, budget-friendly means to planning meals while offering an engaging social media platform where users can express their creativity to the community.
- **Market:**
    - Most people cook, so this app would be a valuable supplement for many people looking for new cooking ideas.
- **Habit:**
    - Most people have at least three meals per day which means there's multiple opportunities to use this app to create content and users could login to browse for other people's recipes all the time.
- **Scope:**
    - The most stripped down version of the app would call an api and display recipes to a user. A step above that would allow users to upload their own recipes and see other users recipes. Our goal for the app is to let users interact with each other and give feedback to other
